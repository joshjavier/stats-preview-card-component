## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While doing accessibility testing for this solution (I used VoiceOver in my iPhone), I found that the title breaks up because of the highlighted span (**insights**). This leads to a bad experience for screen readers, so to fix this, I wrapped my header content in a span with `role="text"`. I did the same to the list items to also prevent them from text splitting.

### Continued development

I thought it's unnecessary for this project, but for bigger projects in the future I'd like to use a [flow CSS utility](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/flow-utility/) for adding space between flow elements. Maybe try using Sass, too?

### Useful resources

- [Text Splitting Causes Screen Reader Problems](https://axesslab.com/text-splitting/) - This article by Daniel GÃ¶ransson, a screen reader user, helped me to fix an issue with VoiceOver splitting the `h1` element because of the `strong` span.
- [Tinted Images with Multiple Backgrounds](https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/) - This article helped me implement the duotone effect in the header image.
- [Aspect Ratio Boxes](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/) - This article talks about the "padding trick" used to achieve a consistent aspect ratio for the header to contain the image properly. (I actually used a simpler implementation like in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22211990/11619513).)
- [Ratio Buddy](https://ratiobuddy.com/) - Nifty tool for calculating the value needed for the padding trick mentioned above.
- [CSS Media queries: grouped with rule-sets or grouped at the bottom?](https://dev.to/jsn1nj4/css-media-queries-grouped-with-rule-sets-or-grouped-at-the-bottom-3ig2) - This quick read gives a look at two common ways to group CSS media queries.
